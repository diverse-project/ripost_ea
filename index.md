The associated team _Resilient and Reproducible Software_ (RIPOST) will research the foundations of “Resilient Software” – software systems which can resist failures without significantly degrading their functionality. Over the past years, resilient software systems have become extremely important in various application domains. By combining Inria’s and Simula´s expertise in software engineering, resilient software, and AI-based software testing, the RIPOST associate team will address the following challenges:
- Reproducing experiments with deep variability
- Replication through automated variation of computational experiments
- Safe and minimal explanations for reproducible scenarios
- Interpretable explanations for reproducible and replicable scenarios

The goal of the RIPOST associate team is to address systematically the reproducibility testing challenge in computer science. It is the continuation of the earlier associate team RESIST_EA.

The RIPOST associate team is composed of ten researchers, five from the Simula department VIAS within the [Software Engineering](https://www.simula.no/research/research-areas/software-engineering/) area and five researchers from the [DiverSE team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/) at Inria Rennes. The associate team will be jointly led by Associate Professor [Mathieu Acher](https://www.mathieuacher.com/) at the University of Rennes, and Research Professor [Arnaud Gotlieb](https://www.simula.no/people/arnaud) from Simula in Norway.

Here are a few pointers:
 * the scientific content (problems solved, tasks performed) can be found through slides (see Github repo https://github.com/gemoc/resist or titles of talks in [Activities](activities)) and papers (see [publications](publications)) 
 * activities (visits, organisation of events, etc.) is available in [Activities](activities)
 * the outcome of RIPOST (publications, software, manuscripts, theses, masters, conference posters, etc.) is available in [publications](publications)
